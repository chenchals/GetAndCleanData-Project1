Data
===========

The zip file contains data from 30 volunteers aged 19-48 years wearing Samsung Galaxy S II smart phone on the waist. It consists of measurements from embedded accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. Measurements were samples at 50Hz in X, Y, and Z planes for linear acceleration and angular velocity.  The dtaa was also partitioned into test (28%) and train (72%) datasets.
